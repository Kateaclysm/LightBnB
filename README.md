# LightBNB

This repository is an "AirBNB" clone that uses server-side javascript to query a database via SQL. The application itself is a simple, single-page web page. All of the data in the database is seeded, and are not real properties. It is purely for experimentation and educational purposes.

## Features

- All content in the application is rendered on a single page, ensuring a fluid and fast user experience.
- Utilizes SQL queries to retrieve and display requested information.
- A multi-option search function for properties that includes price range, city, and rating parameters.
- A "Create Listing" option for those who want to add their own property to the database.
- A "My Reservations" tab for keeping track of current user reservations.
